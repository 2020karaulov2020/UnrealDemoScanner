This tool will be a cross engine fully featured demo analyzing tool. It will work with GoldSource and Source-engine demos. Only Source engine demos supported at the moment.

Features:
  - Changing font
  - Parsing source engine demos
  - Viewing what's happening in the demos (improved version of netdecode)
  - Global hotkeys
  
Coming soonâ„¢:
  - Heatmap generation
  - Exporting demo data as XML
  
  If you have any idea for a feature please make an Issue and I will most likely add it.
